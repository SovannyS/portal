       <p>My name is Sovanny Seng and I am an aspiring software developer. Currently I am enrolled in a condensed 6 month program at Year-Up, which provides college credited courses and an internship for software development. Throughout the program, many projects have been completed which you are able to view with my GitHub link and for any questions you can reach me at my LinkedIn !  </p>
           
      <p>Prior to the program I graduated with an Associates degree of biology at Highline College and worked as a periodontal assistant. The sudden career change is partly due to a new fond interest in the field and realizing the lack of representation of South East Asians in the tech industry, specifically Cambodians. Aside from programming and being a student, some hobbies of mine include: Traveling, playing pickle ball and being a foodie !</p>
